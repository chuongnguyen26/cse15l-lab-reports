### Step 1 : Log into ieng6

Key Pressed: 
```
<Ctrl-R> ssh <enter>
```

* The ssh cs15lwi23afp@ieng6.ucsd.edu command was in the search history. But since I don't know where exactly in the search history, I pressed "**Ctrl-R**" to enable search command and searched for the "ssh" pattern. When I found the correct "ssh" command, I pressed "**enter**" to run the "ssh" command line. Since I know that I only use ssh for logging in, searching for the command pattern in the search history will be faster.

### Step 2 : Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

Key Pressed:
```
<Ctrl-R> git <enter>
```

* The git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/skill-demo1-data command was in the search history. But since I don't know where exactly in the search history, I pressed "**Ctrl-R**" to enable search command and searched for the "git" pattern. When I found the correct "git" command, I pressed "**enter**" to run the "git" command line and start cloning the git repo. Since I know that "git clone" lab7 repo was the most recent "git clone" command line I called, by searching "git" pattern should give me the correct git clone command of lab7 repo.

---

### Step 3 : Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Key Pressed
```
cd l <tab><enter>
```

* The cd lab7/ command changes my current directory to lab7. Since I know that lab7 is the only sub-directory in my current directory, I pressed "**tab**" to autofill the name of the sub-directory after finished typing "cd l". Once autofill is completed, I pressed "**enter**" to run the command line and change my directory to lab7.

Key Pressed
```
<Ctrl-R> javac <enter>
```

* The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java command was in the search history. But since I don't know where exactly in the search history, I pressed "**Ctrl-R**" to enable search command and searched for the "javac" pattern. When I found the correct "javac" command, I pressed "**enter**" to run the "javac" command line and start compiling all java files in the directory. Since I know that "javac" of files in lab7 was the most recent "javac" type command line I called, by searching "javac" pattern should give me the correct javac command line to compile all java files exist in lab7.

Key Pressed
```
<Ctrl-R> java <space><enter>
```

* The java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples command was in the search history. But since I don't know where exactly in the search history, I pressed "**Ctrl-R**" to enable search command and searched for the "java" pattern. But since "javac" also contains the substring "java", typing "java" alone won't be helpful. To have the pattern "java" stands as its own word, press "**space**" immediately after "java". Once I found the correct "java" command, I pressed "**enter**" to run the "java" command line that will run the TestListExamples file. Since I know that I only ran "java" command line on TestListExamples file prior to the competition, by searching through the search history with the pattern "java**space**>" will give me the correct command line.

### Step 4 : Edit the code file to fix the failing test

### Step 5 : Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
 
### Step 6 : Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
